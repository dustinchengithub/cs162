CS162 Operating Systems and Systems Programming projects 1-3 combined

I took this class at UC Berkeley Spring 2020. https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp20/
We had 3 projects throughout the school year, each one working on a different aspect of our class OS.
Part 1 was working on things related to user programs. The main tasks were to parse user input and set up the kernel, set up process controll syscalls, and file operation syscalls.
Part 2 was focused on scheduling. This involved creating an efficient alarm clock to put threads to sleep and wake them up and a priority scheduler that also implements priority donation.
Part 3 was on file systems. The tasks were to impement the buffer cache, extensible files, and subdirectories.
